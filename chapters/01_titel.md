## Software Product Line Engineering in der Automobilindustrie

Note:
A Practical Example of Software Product Line Engineering from the Automotive Industry
In the automotive sector, suppliers provide ready-made products to car manufacturers to boost revenue and stay competitive. But car manufacturers demand customised products to gain unique selling points. Every client request can potentially require a new software project. Simply copying an old one ensures initial functionality, but results in enduring software erosion. The use of Software Product Lines (SPL) allows for the maximisation of reusability and quality. Our open-source system, which relies on VS Code and CMake, facilitates Test-Driven Development (TDD) in the C/C++ language and enables Continuous Integration (CI) for SPLs.

Target Audience: SW Developers, Architects and DevOps
Prerequisites: Experience with C/C++ might be an advantage.

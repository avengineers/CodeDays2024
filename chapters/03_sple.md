### Chuck Norris vs. Humans

Note:
The reason why Chuck Norris does not need to attend this meeting is obvious.
His workflow is quite straightforward. Whatever he delivers works :D
For us humans it looks a bit different ... one stays in such a loop until things
are working as expected.
Luckilly we have standards to help us with this!
